  abstract = {Electricity theft is a major concern for the utilities. With the advent of smart meters, the frequency of collecting household energy consumption data has increased, making it possible for advanced data analysis, which was not possible earlier. We have proposed a temperature dependent predictive model which uses smart meter data and data from distribution transformer to detect electricity theft in an area. The model was tested for varying amounts of power thefts and also for different types of circuit approximations. The results are encouraging and the model can be used for real world application.},

  abstract = {Data from utility meters (gas, electricity, water) is a rich source of information for distribution companies, beyond billing. In this paper we present a supervised technique, which primarily but not only feeds on meter information, to detect meter anomalies and customer fraudulent behavior (meter tampering). Our system detects anomalous meter readings on the basis of models built using machine learning techniques on past data. Unlike most previous work, it can incrementally incorporate the result of field checks to grow the database of fraud and non-fraud patterns, therefore increasing model precision over time and potentially adapting to emerging fraud patterns. The full system has been developed with a company providing electricity and gas and already used to carry out several field checks, with large improvements in fraud detection over the previous checks which used simpler techniques.},

@article{Nikovski2013,
  abstract = {We propose a method for power theft detection based on predictive models for technical losses in electrical distribution networks estimated entirely from data collected by smart meters in smart grids. Although the data sampling rate of smart meters is not sufficiently high to detect power theft with complete certainty, detection is still possible in a statistical decision theory sense, based on statistical models estimated from collected data sets. Even without detailed knowledge of the exact topology of the distribution network, it is possible to estimate a statistical model of the technical losses that allows indirect estimation of the non-technical losses (power theft) with high},
